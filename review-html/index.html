		<h1>A Brief Review of Pyre</h1>
		<p>By the end of the fourteen hours it took me to finish Pyre, I was in tears, in the best way.</p>
		<p>The latest outing by Supergiant Games, of Bastion and Transistor cult fame, Pyre in many ways picks up where its predecessors left off. It’s a tightly focused experience without a lot of extra content or playtime. Yet Supergiant clearly know their strengths, because Pyre’s scope leaves you wanting for nothing. What it lacks in size, it makes up for with a moving story, irresistible characters, gorgeous visuals, a phenomenal soundtrack, and action gameplay that’s simple, but challenging.</p>
		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>The concept is a little…odd. In the fantasy world of Pyre, you’ve been convicted of the capital crime of literacy. The sentence: exile to the hellish underworld of the Downside, from which there’s supposedly no escape. That’s not going to stop you, though, because a ragtag band of fellow exiles has shown you a secret. An ancient book tells of the Rites through which you can gain your freedom…by winning at magic basketball.</p>
		<p>Okay, it’s not quite that silly. The Rites are a mystical contest of body, mind, and spirit, where only the worthy prevail and go free. As you progress, you’ll also uncover a plot to overthrow the government that exiled you, and help determine the fate of the surface world.</p>
		<p>The real core of Pyre, though, is the characters. They overflow with believable personality, endearingly and humanly flawed (even those who aren’t human). By the end, I came to love every one, even those I thought I’d hate at first. And that’s just your own team—your opponents get almost as much fleshing out, so much that by the end, you can’t help but question whether some of them aren’t just as deserving of freedom as your friends. It’s that conflict, who deserves their freedom and who gets it, that the game puts front-and-center. And the gameplay makes you feel the stakes.</p>
		<h2>The Game</h2>
		<p>The Rites are the bulk of the proper gameplay. You control your team of three characters in real time, top-down. The goal: grab the celestial orb and get it into the other team’s pyre to score. They’re trying to do the same to you, of course. Everything else builds on that. There are tackles, ranged attacks, different character classes, equipable relics. Enough to be flexible without needing hours to master.</p>
		<p>On normal difficulty, the Rites start off easy. By the end, each one is a pulse-pounding challenge—even more so because you only get one shot, with the game’s constant autosave. Success and failure are accounted for, and the story moves on. Your actions feel like they matter.</p>
		<p>Between Rites, you get to hang out with your fellow exiles. These moments play out in visual novel form, with text boxes and static portraits. Your dialogue choices can affect people’s personal arcs, as well as their stats in the Rites. Considering the focus on the characters, these scenes might be what really make the game worthwhile. I never found them boring, though you might if you don’t like reading.</p>
		<h2>The Presentation</h2>
		<p>Visually, Pyre is just as impressive as its writing. The art is divided between detailed character portraits, and backgrounds somewhere between cartoons and stained glass. Everything is a riot of color, and explodes with personality. Like the magic sports gameplay, some of the animations can clash with the otherwise serious tone a bit, but I didn’t find it a huge issue.</p>
		<p>And I can’t get away without mentioning the soundtrack. If it’s not my favorite ever, it’s up there. Not many studios know how to really craft music and game storytelling together like Supergiant. In interlude scenes, it’s mostly pretty subdued, just enough to be atmospheric without distracting from the text. During the Rites, the energy is cranked up, with every opponent getting their own leitmotif that brings across their character almost as much as their dialogue. And not to spoil anything, but whenever the vocals come in, prepare yourself for some heart-wrenching stuff. When the minstrel offers to play something, always say yes. You’ll know what I mean.</p>
		<h2>The Verdict</h2>
		<p>At a little over a dollar per hour I got out of it, Pyre isn’t for those who need longevity or replay value. Even with the added versus mode (against the computer only, no two-player), there’s not much to come back to after the credits. Nonetheless, I consider every cent I spent on this game more than worth it. It’s something really special, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.</p>
