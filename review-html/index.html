        <h1>A Brief Review of Pyre</h1>

        <p>By the end of the fourteen hours it took me to finish Pyre, I was in tears, in the best way.</p>
        
        <p>The latest outing by Supergiant Games, of Bastion and Transistor cult fame, Pyre in many ways picks up where its predecessors left off.  It’s a tightly focused experience without a lot of extra content or playtime.  Yet Supergiant clearly know their strengths, because Pyre’s scope leaves you wanting for nothing.  What it lacks in size, it makes up for with a moving story, irresistible characters, gorgeous visuals, a phenomenal soundtrack, and action gameplay that’s simple, but challenging.</p>

        <h1>The Story</h1>

        <p>The concept is a little…odd.  In the fantasy world of Pyre, you’ve been convicted of the capital crime of literacy.  The sentence: exile to the hellish underworld of the Downside, from which there’s supposedly no escape.  That’s not going to stop you, though, because a ragtag band of fellow exiles has shown you a secret.  A magic book tells of the Rites through which you can gain your freedom…by winning at magic basketball.</p>

        <p>Okay, it’s not quite that silly.  The Rites are a mystical contest of body, mind, and spirit, where only the worthy prevail and go free.  As you progress, you’ll uncover a plot to overthrow the government that exiled you, and help determine the fate of the surface world.</p>

        <p>The real core of Pyre, though, is the characters—put simply, they’re wonderful.  By the end, I came to love every one, even those I thought I’d hate at first.  And the story puts them front and center, with their fates key to that of the world…and squarely in your hands.  With the game’s continuous autosave system, the pressure’s on you to win the Rites for your friends.  And the gameplay makes you feel it.</p>

        <h1>The Game</h1>

        <p>The Rites are the bulk of the proper gameplay.  You control your team of three characters in real time, top-down.  The goal: grab the celestial orb and get it into the other team’s pyre to score.  They’re trying to do the same to you, of course.  Everything else builds on that.  There are tackles, ranged attacks, different character classes, equipable relics.  Enough to be flexible without needing hours to master.</p>

        <p>On normal difficulty, the Rites start off easy.  By the end, each one is a pulse-pounding challenge—even more so because you only get one shot.  Success and failure are accounted for, and the game moves on.  Your actions feel like they matter.</p>

        <p>Between Rites, you get to hang out with your fellow exiles.  These moments play out in visual novel form, with text boxes and static portraits.  Your dialogue choices can affect people’s personal arcs, as well as their stats in the Rites.  Considering the focus on the characters, these scenes might be what really make the game worthwhile.  I never found them boring, though you might if you don’t like reading.</p>

        <h1>The Presentation</h1>

        <p>Visually, Pyre is just as impressive as its writing.  The art is divided between detailed character portraits, and backgrounds somewhere between cartoons and stained glass.  Everything is a riot of color, and explodes with personality.  Like the magic sports gameplay, some of the animations can clash with the otherwise serious tone a bit, but I didn’t find it a huge issue.</p>

        <p>And I can’t get away without mentioning the soundtrack.  If it’s not my favorite ever, it’s up there.  Not many studios know how to really craft music and game storytelling together like Supergiant.  The character leitmotifs during Rites and soothing ambient tunes in interludes set the tone perfectly.  And not to spoil anything, but whenever the vocals come in, prepare yourself for some heart-wrenching stuff.</p>

        <h1>The Verdict</h1>

        <p>At a little over a dollar per hour I got out of it, Pyre isn’t for those who need longevity or replay value.  Even with the added versus mode (against the computer only, no two-player), there’s not much to come back to after the credits.  Nonetheless, I consider every cent I spent on this game more than worth it.  It’s something really special, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.</p>
